# Intro and motivation
Metropolis is a simple tool for tracking software data structures and their interactions within a project.

Describe your models, entities, etc., and see how they relate to one another in a diagram (drawn using [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)).

## Modular design
The application consists of 3 main parts: client, persistence layer and core logic. These parts are named accordingly: Theater, Gymnasium, Temple. Each module has its own README.md file containing module-specific information.

## Overview
The simplest usage flow would be as follows: create a [project](./projects/project.md), add a [model](./projects/model.md), add another [model](./projects/model.md), add a couple of [attributes](./projects/attribute.md) add [association](./projects/association.md), then check a diagram.
