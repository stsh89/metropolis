# Intro and motivation
Metropolis is a highly specialized Architecture Design and Documentation Tool.

## Modular design
The application consists of 3 main parts: client, persistence layer and core logic. These parts are named accordingly: Theater, Gymnasium, Temple.

## Overview
The simplest usage flow would be as follows: create a [project](./projects.md), set up project layers, describe layers, track implementation, add more details and improve what you already have.
